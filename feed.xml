Matthew Harris and Stephen Treaster taught during the first session, lecturing and guiding experimental techniques in comparative genomics, zebrafish genetics, and clam development, to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the aging process.</p>

<p>Our intrepid students had the opportunity to test their own theories of aging in these experimental systems.</p>
